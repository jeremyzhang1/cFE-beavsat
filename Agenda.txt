Stuff we need to do today:
Figure out cFS
Build sample app

Request from GNC/ACDS:
Make app that gets GPS data and output it for the photo.

Notes from the meeting 07/22
We do not have GPS on the cubesat.
Keep the app short and simple, use few apps.
We need a power budget from the power team.

What are we working on?
Austin - Telemetry Gather
Jeremy - Assisting with the telemetry gathering app
Stanley - Payload camera app/interface, Design for some board

July 30:
Prototype or get done the telemetry app. We can send the data from this app to other apps that need it
Over the course of the week, we will work with other subsystems to create apps.
We can make a template for the other subsystems, easier for other teams to get their programming done.
Needs:
Power and thermal safe ranges for the safety monitor app.
